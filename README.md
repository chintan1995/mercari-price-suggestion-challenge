# mercari-price-suggestion-challenge
This repo shows my approach on solving the Mercari's Price Suggestion on Kaggle and how I got my score at the 66th Position on the Private leaderboard (Top 2.77%).
The competition already ended when I started solving it, so techinically I couldn't make my way into the leaderboard. But it was a good challenge to solve, and see where my score would have ended up if I had participated.
